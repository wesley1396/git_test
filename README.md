This is my first Github repo!
Hello Odin, progress is slow as I have a family. But So far I am about 2 weeks in, dedicating at least a little time every day. My goal is to be consistent and work towards my goal at least a little each day. 
Very excited to look back at this and see how far ive come!
I wont give up.
